# M3_WIPER_SYSTEM
# Abstract
#
**This project is based on implementing the *__WIPER SYSYTEM__*. A windscreen wiper, windshield wiper or wiper blade is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, and/or debris from a vehicle's front window as well as used in rear window. The wiper system is used to detect rainfall and activate wiper automatically with driver interaction. This system fulfills the safety of the drivers to focus on their primary task of providing clear view from in side for driving.Here in the project the first time button press is assumed as the ignition key for car, the action should occur is glow red led to show it is turned on.This project shows  the wiper's differnt speed when button pressed.To overcome different types of rain speeds, different speed's of wiper movement is enabled on every key press.The starting position of wiper is denoted as blue led and far postion is orange led.**

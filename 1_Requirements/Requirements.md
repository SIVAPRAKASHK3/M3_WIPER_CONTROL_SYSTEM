# REQUIREMENTS

##  Feautures
     * Easy in controlling speeds of wiper rotate movement.
     * Turning on/off car on button for 2 Seconds.
     * controlling speeds using button press count.

## Research
    * Referred many research papers on wiper control.
    * Referred many e-sources for coding part.
    * Surfed in internet(youtube, google scholar).
       
##  Key feautures
    * Controlling speeds of wiper by key presses.
    * Three differnt speed of wiper rotation available.

# The 4W's and a H 

## WHAT
   * It is the process of operating the wiper system's with 3 differnet speed (1 hz,4 hz,8 hz)under various rainy circumstances.
## WHY
  * The main goal of this project is to control the speed of the wiper system in  rainy conditions.
## WHO
  * Windshield wiper's manufacturers/car manufacturers, who require the controlling of wipers on different speeds.
## WHERE
  * This mainly comes in use on Vehicle front Windshield glasses.
  * Rare windshield wiper which is available in some cars.
## HOW
  * This project is implemented using "Embedded C Program" based on ARM Processors/Controllers.
  * stm32 cubeide is also used.
# SWOT ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
 ## STRENGTHS:
    * Easily Operating.
    * Easy controlling of speed's.
 ## WEAKNESS:
    * No sensor control of wiper action.
    * STM32 board need period maintance to work fine.
    * Firmware upadte is not provided.
 ## THREATS:
    * Failure of operation may lead to wiper struck in any position .
    * Accident may occur if not has maintance or software update is not done.
